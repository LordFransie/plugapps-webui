Yea, stuff is broken this is an inital port from the web2py version to django

To deploy for development just clone the git tree, navigate to the directory and run "python2.7 manage.py runserver".

To deploy for use, clone the git tree so that the files are in /opt/webui/ (be careful to not have /opt/webui/plugapps-webui when cloning) then run "pacman -S python-distribute", then "easy_install-2.7 fapws3". 

Then to run the server, change to the webui directory and run "./webui start". 

If you want the webui to start at boot, run "ln -s /opt/webui/webui /etc/rc.d/webui", then add "webui" to the daemon section of /etc/rc.conf
